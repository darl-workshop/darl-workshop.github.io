      <td><b><a href="https://www.davidsilver.uk/">David Silver</a></b> leads the reinforcement learning team at DeepMind. He is also a professor at University College London. David’s work focuses on artificially intelligent agents based on reinforcement learning. David led or co-led projects that played Atari games directly from pixels (Nature 2015), defeated a world champion in the game of Go (Nature 2016), learned by itself to defeat the world’s strongest chess, shogi and Go programs (Nature 2017, Science 2018), even without knowledge of the rules (Science 2020), and defeated professional StarCraft players (Nature 2019). He also contributed to AlphaFold, the program that solved the protein folding problem (Nature 2020, Nature 2021). His work has been recognised by the ACM Prize in Computing, Marvin Minsky award, Mensa Foundation Prize, Royal Academy of Engineering Silver Medal, ACM Fellowship and Royal Society Fellowship.

      <td><b><a href="http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~anca/">Anca Dragan</a></b> is an associate professor in the EECS Department at UC Berkeley. Her goal is to enable robots to work with, around, and in support of people. She runs the InterACT Lab, with the focus on algorithms for human-robot interaction that are aligned with human actual preferences for the robot to do. She also serves on the steering committee for the Berkeley AI Research (BAIR) Lab and as a co-PI of the Center for Human-Compatible AI. Her work been honored by the Sloan Fellowship, MIT TR35, the Okawa award, an NSF CAREER award, and the PECASE award.

      <td><b><a href="http://bamos.github.io/">Brandon Amos</a></b> is a research scientist at Facebook AI Research (FAIR) in NYC. He focuses on integrating structural information and domain knowledge into learning systems to represent non-trivial reasoning operations. A key theme of his work in this space involves the use of optimization as a differentiable building block in larger architectures that are learned end-to-end.

      <td><b><a href="https://www.cs.hmc.edu/people/Talvitie">Erin Talvitie</a></b> is an associate professor of Computer Science at Harvey Mudd College. She graduated from Oberlin College in 2004 with majors in Computer Science and Mathematics and received her Ph.D. from the University of Michigan in 2010. She was a founding member of the Department of Computer Science at Franklin & Marshall College before moving on to Harvey Mudd College in 2019. Her research interests focus on reinforcement learning, specifically with the aim of understanding how autonomous agents can learn to act flexibly and competently in complicated, unknown environments. Her NSF CAREER grant "Using Imperfect Predictions to Make Good Decisions" has funded recent work studying model-based reinforcement learning in the case where the agent's model class is insufficient to capture the true environment dynamics.

      <td><b><a href="http://louiskirsch.com/">Louis Kirsch</a></b> is a fourth-year PhD student at the Swiss AI Lab IDSIA, advised by Prof. Jürgen Schmidhuber. He received his MRes in Computational Statistics and Machine Learning from University College London (1st rank) and interned at DeepMind. His research focus is on meta-learning general-purpose learning algorithms. His work includes MetaGenRL on meta-learning reinforcement learning algorithms as objective functions and VSML on discovering novel general learning algorithms that do not rely on backpropagation. Louis has co-organized the BeTR-RL workshop at ICLR 2020, the NERL workshop at ICLR 2021, and has been an invited speaker at Meta Learn NeurIPS 2020. Further, he won several GPU compute awards for the Swiss national supercomputer Piz Daint.

She is a world leader in cognitive science, particularly the study of children’s learning and development. Alison is especially interested in how children learn about the causal structure of the world—how some things make other things happen. Her lab explores how children learn by observing statistical patterns, doing experiments and watching the experiments of others.</td>
