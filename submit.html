<p>We invite submissions with theoretical, algorithmic, and empirical contributions on topics, including, but not limited to,</p>
<ul>
<li>Decision-aware objectives, end-to-end procedures, and meta-learning techniques for training and discovering components in modular RL systems</li>
<li>Theoretical and empirical analyses of the interaction among multiple modules used by RL algorithms</li>
<li>Studies of the performance of model-based RL agents under model misspecification</li>
<li>The role of unsupervised learning and auxiliary training signals in RL and their relation to decision-awareness</li>
<li>Connections with other fields such as control theory, cognitive science, and robotics</li>
</ul>
<!-- <p>For a more detailed summary of questions we are particularly excited about, please visit the <a href="index.html"> front page</a>.</p> -->

<!-- <p> We shall accept submissions of up to 8 pages of content (with no limit on references and supplementary material) that have not been previously accepted at an archival venue (such as ICML, NeurIPS, ICLR). While up to 8 pages of content is allowed, we strongly encourage authors to limit their submission to 4-6 pages, to ensure higher quality reviewer feedback. Papers can utilize any style file they want (for e.g., ICML, NeurIPS, ICLR) and should be anonymized for double blind review. </p> -->
<p>We welcome submissions in both short (up to 4 pages excluding references and appendices) and long (up to 9 pages excluding references and appendices) formats. The papers should contain new material, not already accepted for publication in other venues; papers currently under review for other venues are allowed. Submissions will be reviewed in a double-blind process, managed in OpenReview. We will release talk videos on our workshop website, along with all accepted papers (non-archival proceedings, so future publication is allowed). In case authors of an accepted paper cannot present their work in person, we will ask provide a recorded video of the duration up to 5 minutes.</p>

<p> <b> Evaluation Criteria</b>: We plan to evaluate papers based on novelty, technical soundness, clarity, and potential impact. We are happy to accept works-in-progress to encourage discussion at the workshop. </p>

<p>We do not enforce any hard constraint on the template to be followed, but we recommend you to employ the <a href="https://icml.cc/Conferences/2022/StyleAuthorInstructions">default ICML 2022 template</a>.</p>

<p><b>The submission deadline is May 27, 2022, Anywhere on Earth.</b></p>
