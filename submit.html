<p>We invite submissions with theoretical, algorithmic, and empirical contributions on topics, including, but not limited to,</p>
<ul>
<li>Decision-aware objectives, end-to-end procedures, and meta-learning techniques for training and discovering components in modular RL systems</li>
<li>Theoretical and empirical analyses of the interaction among multiple modules used by RL algorithms</li>
<li>Studies of the performance of model-based RL agents under model misspecification</li>
<li>The role of unsupervised learning and auxiliary training signals in RL and their relation to decision-awareness</li>
<li>Connections with other fields such as control theory, cognitive science, and robotics</li>
</ul>
<p>For a more detailed summary of questions we are particularly excited about, please visit the <a href="index.html"> front page</a>. We are also interested in the implications and real-world applications of these techniques, as well as in widening the understanding of the conceptual and practical limitations of existing approaches.</p>

<!-- <p> We shall accept submissions of up to 8 pages of content (with no limit on references and supplementary material) that have not been previously accepted at an archival venue (such as ICML, NeurIPS, ICLR). While up to 8 pages of content is allowed, we strongly encourage authors to limit their submission to 4-6 pages, to ensure higher quality reviewer feedback. Papers can utilize any style file they want (for e.g., ICML, NeurIPS, ICLR) and should be anonymized for double blind review. </p> -->
<p>We welcome submissions in both short (up to 4 pages excluding references and appendices) and long (up to 9 pages excluding references and appendices) formats. The papers should contain new material, not already accepted for publication in other venues; papers currently under review for other venues will be considered. Submissions will be reviewed in a double-blind process, managed in OpenReview. To increase accessibility, we will release talk videos on our workshop website, along with all accepted papers. In case authors of accepted papers cannot present their work in person, we will ask provide a recorded video of the duration up to 5 minutes.</p>

<p> <b> Evaluation Criteria</b>: We plan to evaluate papers based on novelty, technical soundness, clarity, and potential impact. We are happy to accept works-in-progress to encourage discussion at the workshop. </p>
